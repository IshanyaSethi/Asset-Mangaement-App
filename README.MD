**Solution**: Return asset first, or mark as "Retired"

### Duplicate Serial Number Error
**Reason**: Another asset already uses that serial number
**Solution**: Check existing assets, use a different serial number

### Asset Not Showing in Assignment Dropdown
**Reason**: Asset status is not "Available"
